1705.02798v6,How does reattention affect the redundancy and deficiency of attention distributions? Can you explain the observed differences in the impact of reattention on different blocks?,"This paper shows that reattention helps alleviate both redundancy and deficiency in attention distributions.

Redundancy: Reattention increases the KL divergence between adjacent attention blocks, indicating that the attention distributions across blocks become more distinct and less redundant.
Deficiency: Reattention reduces the KL divergence between the normalized attention distribution ($E^t$) and the ideal uniform distribution (${E^t}^*$), suggesting that the attention becomes more balanced and closer to the desired distribution.
However, the improvement in redundancy is more pronounced between the first two blocks ($E^1$ to $E^2$) than the last two blocks ($B^2$ to $B^3$). This suggests that the first reattention is more effective in capturing word pair similarities using the original word representations.

This means VAGER attempts to apply knowledge from other classes to improve its performance on new classes. For nine out of the ten novel classes, this strategy seems to be successful, as VAGER consistently outperforms LR.
