It leverages the strengths of both the convolutional layer to discover the local dependency patterns among multi-dimensional input variables and the recurrent layer to captures complex long-term dependencies. A novel recurrent structure, namely Recurrent-skip, is designed for capturing very long-term dependence patterns and making the optimization easier as it utilizes the periodic property of the input time series signals.",
