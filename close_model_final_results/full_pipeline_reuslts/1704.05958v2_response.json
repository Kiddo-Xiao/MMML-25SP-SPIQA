Our key hypothesis is that global statistics is more robust to noise than local statistics.",

No prior study has exploited global statistics to combat the wrong labeling problem of distant supervision.",
      "Large-scale training data of embedding can be easily solicited from distant supervision, and the global statistics of relations provide a natural way to combat the wrong labeling problem of distant supervision. The idea of relation embedding based on global statistics can be further expanded along several directions. In this work we have focused on embedding textual relations, but it is in principle beneficial to jointly embed knowledge base relations and optionally entities.",

      "However, the learned textual relation embedding turned out to be not very helpful for relation extraction. One possible reason is that PPMI (even the smoothed version) gives inappropriately large weights to rare relations .

It is worth noting that other models like convolutional neural networks can also be used, but it is not the focus of this paper to compare all the alternative embedding models; rather, we aim to show the effectiveness of global statistics with a reasonable embedding model.",
