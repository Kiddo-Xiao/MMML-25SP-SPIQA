      "For example, the full training of the network is around 6-7 minutes, which does not increase with even 512 extra samples. At the point of diminishing returns, i.e.\\ at 2048 extra samples, training time is still around 7-8 minutes, which is only a slight increase. After that, training times grow quickly, due to exceeding the parallelization capabilities of the GPU we used.",
      "BPR-max improves with more samples all the way, but slightly loses accuracy when all items are used. Adding extra samples increases computational cost, yet due to easy parallelization on modern GPUs most of this cost is alleviated. Figure~ shows the training times at different sample sizes.",
      "On the other hand, all three of the other losses react well to adding more samples. The point of diminishing returns is around a few thousand of extra samples for cross-entropy. TOP1-max starts to slightly lose accuracy after that.",
      "Please note the logarithmic scale. The actual training time depends on not just the dataset, but on the model parameters as well (especially mini-batch size) and how certain operators used for computing the loss are supported by the framework. The trend, however, is similar for all losses.",
      "The trend is similar on the VIDEO dataset, with training times starting around 20 minutes, starting to increase at 2048 extra samples (to 24 minutes) and quickly above thereafter. This means that the proposed method can be used with zero to little additional cost in practice, unlike data augmentation methods. It is also clear that GRU4Rec can work just as well with a few thousands of negative examples as with the whole itemset, thus it can be kept scalable.",
      "As we discussed earlier, this latter scenario is a more theoretical one, because it is not scalable. As theory suggests (see Section~), the TOP1 loss does not cope well with lots of samples. There is a slight increase in performance with a few extra samples, as the chance of having relevant samples increases; but performance quickly degrades as sample size grows, thus lots of irrelevant samples are included.",
      "Adding more samples naturally increases the complexity, since N_O increases from N_B to N_A+N_B. However, the computations are easily parallelizable, thus there is no actual increase in the training time on modern GPUs up to a certain sample size (see Section~). The efficient implementation of this sampling however is not trivial.",
      "Unlike our solutions, data augmentation greatly increases training times. Data augmentation and our improvements are not mutually exclusive, thus it is possible that by combining the two methods, even better results can be achieved. A recent paper proposes the Bayesian version of GRU4Rec and reports \\sim0.61 and \\sim0.25 in recall@20 and MRR@20 when using 100 units."

The rightmost figure focuses on the first 200 ranks of the figure in the middle. The gradient is slightly higher for BPR when there are more relevant samples (i.e.\\ high ranks).",
      "For example the gradient of BPR-max w.r.t.\\ a negative sample's score is as follows: Figure~ depicts how the gradients of BPR and BPR-max behave given the rank of the target item. The rank of the target is the number of negative scores exceeding it, e.g.\\ rank 0 means that the target score is higher than all sample scores. Lower rank means that there are fewer negative samples that are relevant.",
      "As r_i becomes higher, the focus shifts quickly to the samples with high scores. This is an ideal behaviour. The gradient w.r.t.\\ a negative sample -- with both the BPR-max and TOP1-max -- is proportional to the softmax score of the example, meaning that only the items, near the maximum will be updated.",
      "Of course, if all samples are irrelevant, the gradient becomes near zero, but this is not a problem, since if the target score is greater than all sample scores, there is nothing to be learned. Unfortunately, the sensitivity to large sample scores of TOP1 is still an issue as it is the consequence of the TOP1 pairwise loss and not the aggregation. BPR-max: Going back to the probability interpretation of BPR, the goal is to maximize the probability of the target score being higher than the maximal sample score r_{\\mathrm{max=\\max_{j{r_j.",
      "This is beneficial, because if the score of a negative sample is low, it doesn't need to be updated. If the score of a sample is much higher than that of the others it will be the only one updated and the gradient will coincide with the gradient of the pairwise loss between the target and the sample score. In a more balanced setting the gradient is between the aforementioned gradient and 0.",
      "For example, when comparing a niche target to a very popular sample -- especially during the early phase of learning -- the target score might be much lower than the sample score. We concentrated on the gradients w.r.t.\\ the target score, but a similar issue can be observed for the gradients on the negative scores. The gradient w.r.t.\\ the score of a negative sample is the gradient of the pairwise loss between the target and the sample divided by the number of negative samples.",
      "The point of vanishing is relative to the total sample size. With small sample size, BPR's gradient starts vanishing around rank 5 (the BPR-max does not vanish until rank 0); meanwhile, with more samples, the BPR gradient is very low, even for rank 100-500 (again, the gradient BPR-max starts decreasing significantly later). This means that BPR can hardly push target scores up in the ranking after a certain point, which comes earlier as the number of sample size increases."
