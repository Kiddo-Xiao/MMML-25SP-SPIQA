      "When experimenting on different scene classification tasks using different selections of scenes, we only use the training/testing data associated with those selected scenes as the T-R data. Training Details We use Caffe~ to implement ZDDA. Table~ lists the base network architecture (BNA) we use and the layer separating the source/target CNN and the source classifier in Fig.~. For instance, in the case when the BNA is LeNet~, the architecture of each source/target CNN in Fig.~ is the LeNet~ architecture up to the ``ip1\" layer, and the rest of the LeNet~ architecture is used as the source classifier.",
      "For the DA tasks involving D_M, D_F, D_N, and D_E, we use the LeNet~ as the BNA and train all the CNNs in Fig.~ from scratch except that the target CNN is pre-trained from the T-I dataset and fixed afterwards. For example, when using D_F and D_F-M as the T-I data in the DA task D_M\\rightarrow D_M-M, we train a CNN (denoted as CNN_{ref) with the LeNet~ architecture from scratch using the images and labels of D_F-M, and pre-train the target CNNs in Fig.~ from CNN_{ref. We follow similar procedures for other DA tasks and T-I datasets involving D_M, D_F, D_N, and D_E.",
      "After step 2, we can form the scene classifier in depth/RGB (denoted as C_D/C_{RGB) by concatenating s2/t and the trained source classifier (as shown in Fig.~), which meets our first goal, domain adaptation. We use the notation ZDDA_2 to refer to the method using the training procedure in Fig.~ up to step 2 and the testing procedure in Fig.~. To perform sensor fusion, we propose step 3, where we train a joint classifier for RGB-D input using only the T-R depth training data. We create two CNNs, s3 and s4 (each with the same network architecture as that of CNN_{s\\text{1), and add a concatenation layer on top of them to concatenate their output representations.",
      "When the BNA is LeNet~, we train the classifier from scratch. For the other BNAs, we pre-train the classifier in the same way as that described in Sec.~. After training, for each DA task, we get two fully supervised classifiers C_{fs,s and C_{fs,t in the source and target domains respectively. For the baseline of the DA task, we directly feed the target-domain testing images to C_{fs,s to obtain the performance without applying any DA method.",
      "One industrial use case which we plan to apply ZDDA to in our follow-up work is training an RGD object classifier given only the textureless CAD models of those objects. In this case, depth and RGB images are source and target domains, respectively. The depth images can be rendered from the provided CAD models, and publicly available RGB-D datasets can serve as the task-irrelevant RGB-D data.",
      "For the experiment involving D_S, we mostly use GoogleNet~ as the BNA, but we also use AlexNet~ and SqueezeNet\\_v1.1~ in the cross validation experiment with respect to different BNAs. Since only limited amount of RGB-D pairs are available in D_S, we pre-train all the CNNs in Fig.~ from the BVLC GoogleNet model~, BVLC AlexNet model~, and the reference SqueezeNet model~ when the BNA is GoogleNet~, AlexNet~, and SqueezeNet\\_v1.1~, respectively. These pre-trained models are trained for the ImageNet~ classification task.",

The 3-step training procedure of ZDDA in Fig.~ can be framed as an end-to-end training process with proper learning curriculum. We separate these 3 steps due to the ease of explanation."

      "Although different strategies such as the domain adversarial loss~ and the domain confusion loss~ are proposed to improve the performance in the DA tasks, most of the existing methods need the T-R target-domain training data, which can be unavailable in reality. In contrast, we propose ZDDA to learn from the T-I dual-domain pairs without using the T-R target-domain training data. One part of ZDDA includes simulating the target-domain representation using the source-domain data, and similar concepts have been mentioned in~. However, both of~ require the access to the T-R dual-domain training pairs, but ZDDA needs no T-R target-domain data.",
      "However, in ZDDA, T-R target-domain training data is unavailable and the only available T-R training data is in one source domain. We further compare ZDDA with the existing methods relevant to our problem setting in Table~, which shows that among the listed methods, only ZDDA can work under all four conditions. In terms of sensor fusion, Ngiam et al.~ define the three components for multimodal learning (multimodal fusion, cross modality learning, and shared representation learning) based on the modality used for feature learning, supervised training, and testing, and experiment on audio-video data with their proposed deep belief network and autoencoder based method.",

      "(2) Given no task-relevant target-domain training data, we show that ZDDA can perform sensor fusion and that ZDDA is more robust to noisy testing data in either source or target or both domains compared with a naive fusion approach in the scene classification task from the SUN RGB-D~ dataset. Related Work Domain adaptation (DA) has been extensively studied in computer vision and applied to various applications such as image classification~, semantic segmentation~, and image captioning~. With the advance of deep neural networks in recent years, the state-of-the-art methods successfully perform DA with (fully or partially) labeled~ or unlabeled~ T-R target-domain data.",

Although certain progress about sensor fusion is achieved in the previous works~, we are unaware of any existing sensor fusion method which overcomes the issue of lacking T-R target-domain training data, which is the issue that ZDDA is designed to solve. Our Proposed Method --- ZDDA Given a task of interest (TOI), a source domain D_s, and a target domain D_t, our proposed method, zero-shot deep domain adaptation (ZDDA), is designed to achieve the following two goals: 1) Domain adaptation: Derive the solutions of the TOI for both D_s and D_t when the T-R training data in D_t is unavailable.",
      "Although we only use black images as the noise model for ZDDA_3 at training time, we expect that adding different noise models can improve the robustness of ZDDA_3. Conclusion and Future Work We propose zero-shot deep domain adaptation (ZDDA), a novel approach to perform domain adaptation (DA) and sensor fusion with no need of the task-relevant target-domain training data which can be inaccessible in reality. Rather than solving the zero-shot DA problem in general, we aim at solving the problems under the assumption that task-relevant source-domain data and task-irrelevant dual-domain paired data are available."
