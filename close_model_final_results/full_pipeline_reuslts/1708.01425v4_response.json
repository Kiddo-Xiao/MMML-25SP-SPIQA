In addition, we provide (a) 2,884 user-generated arguments annotated for their stance, covering 50+ controversial topics, (b) 2,026 arguments with annotated reasons supporting the stance, (c) 4,235 rephrased reason gists, useful for argument summarization and sentence compression, and (d) a method for checking the reliability of crowdworkers in document and span labeling using traditional inter-annotator agreement measures.",
      "Moreover, we proposed a methodology to systematically reconstruct implicit warrants in eight consecutive steps. So far, we implemented the methodology in a manual crowdsourcing process, along with a strategy that enables standard~inter-annotator agreement measures in crowdsourcing. Following the process, we constructed a new dataset with 1,970 instances for the task.",
      "Warrant \\rightarrow (therefore) Claim. The warrant takes the role of an inference rule, similar to the major premise in Walton's terminology . In principle, the chain Reason \\rightarrow {\\em Warrant \\rightarrow {\\em Claim is applicable to deductive arguments and syllogisms, which allows us to validate arguments properly formalized in propositional logic.",
      "All 5,342 alternative warrants in our dataset are written under CC-0 license. \\paragraph{6.\\ Alternative Warrant Validation As the previous step produces largely uncontrolled writings, we validate each fabricated alternative warrant AW as to whether it actually relates to the reason~R. To this end, we show AW and \\neg C together with two alternatives: R itself and a distracting reason. Only instances with correctly validated R are kept.",
