      "\\subsubsection*{Related work on tempered MCMC Tempered MCMC is the most popular approach to sampling from multi-modal target distributions (see \\citet{jasraetal:2007:population for a full review). The main idea behind tempered MCMC is to sample from a sequence of tempered targets, \\pi_k(\\bx) \\propto \\exp\\left\\{-\\beta_k\\phi(\\bx)\\right\\, \\quad\\quad k=1,\\ldots,K, where \\beta_k is a tuning parameter referred to as the temperature that is associated with \\pi_k(\\bx).",
      "Introduction Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods (see, e.g., \\citet{brooks2011handbook) are generally regarded as the gold standard approach for sampling from high-dimensional distributions. In particular, MCMC algorithms have been extensively applied within the field of Bayesian statistics to sample from posterior distributions when the posterior density can only be evaluated up to a constant of proportionality. Under mild conditions, it can be shown that asymptotically, the limiting distribution of the samples generated from the MCMC algorithm will converge to the posterior distribution of interest.",
      "In Scenario (a), where the modes are well-separated, the HMC sampler is only able to explore the modes locally clustered together, whereas the pseudo-extended HMC sampler is able to explore all of the modes, for the same number of iterations. Under Scenario (b), the weights and variances of the mixture components are larger than under Scenario (a), as a result, there is a higher density region separating the modes making it easier for the HMC sampler to move between the mixture components. Compared to the pseudo-extended HMC sampler, the HMC sampler is still not able to explore all of the modes of the target.",
      "After 10,000 iterations of the HMC sampler on the original target only one mode is discovered. Applying the same HMC algorithm on the pseudo-extended target, and then weighting the samples (as discussed in Section ), both modes of the original target are discovered and the samples produce a good empirical approximation to the target. % Mixture of Gaussians The pseudo-extended sampler with tempered instrumental distributions (Section ) performs well in both scenarios, where the modes are close or far apart.",

      "The pseudo-extended HMC method is implemented within STAN Mixture of Gaussians Background: We consider a popular example from the literature \\citep{Kou2006,Tak2016a, where the target is a mixture of 20 bivariate Gaussians, \\pi(\\bx) = \\sum_{j=1^{20 \\frac{w_j{2\\pi\\sigma_j^2\\exp\\left\\{\\frac{-1{2\\sigma_j^2(\\bx-\\boldsymbol{\\mu_j)^\\top(\\bx-\\boldsymbol{\\mu_j)\\right\\, and where \\{\\boldsymbol{\\mu_1,\\boldsymbol{\\mu_2,\\ldots,\\boldsymbol{\\mu_{20\\ are specified in \\citet{Kou2006.
