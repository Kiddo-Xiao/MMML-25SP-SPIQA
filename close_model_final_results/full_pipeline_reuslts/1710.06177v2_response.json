      "We randomly choose 10 novel classes and test the performance of our algorithm and baselines on 1/2/3/4/5/10/20/50 shots. The result is shown in Figure . In all scenarios, our algorithm performs the best.",
      "Furthermore, we compare the performances of these methods in different low-shot settings, and the results are shown in Figure . Our method consistently performs the best in all settings, and the advantage of our method is more obvious when the novel classes have less training samples. Especially, by comparing our method and LR, we can see that LR needs about 20 shots to reach AUC 0.9, while we only need 2 shots, indicating that we can save 90\\% training data.",
      "The second experiment is to evaluate our method on different numbers of novel classes. We design an 10/30/50/100-way 1-shot setting. The result is shown in the last four columns in Table .",
      "As the result shows, our algorithm consistently gets the best performance. The third experiment is to evaluate our method on different shots. We control the number of novel classes and change the number of shots used for learning novel classifiers.",
      "We randomly select 10 categories from the novel test categories and learn to distinguish these 10 categories on the 1-shot setting. We repeat random selections five times and the result is shown on the first 5 columns in Table . Our VAGER+Voting performs the best in all 5 groups, with promotion of around 2\\% of average top-1 accuracy, which demonstrates that our method is robust whatever the novel classes are.",
      "To eliminate randomness, for any k-shot setting, we run 50 times and report the average result in the following experiments. Section 4.4 shows an m-way k-shot classification problem, where the new classifier is learned to classify among the m novel classes, which is consistent with the classical setting in few-shot learning. In the training phase, we randomly select m novel classes and select k images from each of these classes as the training dataset.",
      "An interesting phenomenon is that the performance of Weighted-LR does not change as the shot number increases. The main reason is that the heuristic rule is not flexible enough to incorporate new information, which demonstrates the importance of learning to learn, rather than rule-based learning. Insightful Analysis",
      "In the testing phase, we randomly select 5 images per novel class from the rest images as the testing dataset. The experiment will repeat 500 times under each m-way k-shot setting. The evaluating metric in our experiment is the Area Under Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and the F1-score, which are widely used in binary classification."
