Search Strategy: While previous methods primarily rely on greedy search, which becomes increasingly inefficient for longer sequences, Seq2Sick employs group lasso regularization and projected gradient descent with gradient regularization. This allows for simultaneous searching of all replacement positions, leading to improved efficiency.\n\n2. Targeted Attack Type: Existing methods focus on targeting specific classes or binary classifications, while Seq2Sick introduces a novel \"keyword\" target type, allowing attacks to be directed towards specific keywords within the generated sequence.",

      "Therefore, we conclude that, compared with the DNN models designed for other tasks such as image classification, seq2seq models are more robust to adversarial attacks. The main reason, as pointed out in the introduction, is that the seq2seq model has a finite and discrete input space and almost infinite output space, so it is more robust than visual classification models that have an infinite and continuous input space and a very small output space (e.g., 10 categories in MNIST and 1,000 categories in ImageNet). \\end{center \\end{table* \\end{center \\end{table* \\end{center \\end{table* Conclusion In this paper, we propose a novel framework, i.e., Seq2Sick, to generate adversarial examples for sequence-to-sequence neural network models.",

However, even if the proposed approach can successfully attack seq2seq models, our answer to the second question is ``Yes''. Compared with CNN-based classifiers that are highly sensitive to adversarial examples, seq2seq model is intrinsically more robust since it has discrete input space and the output space is exponentially large.",

Analysis of Syntactic structure and Semantic Meaning Preservation In our algorithm we aim to make adversarial examples having similar meaning to original examples by constraining the number of changed words and enforcing the changed words are close to the original words in the embedding space.",
      "It shows that our examples keeps the original syntactic structure. For the semantic meaning part, We use DeepAI's online sentiment analysis {API to test whether our attack changes the sentiment of 500 sentences from DUC2003 dataset in summarization task. The results show that {\\bf only 2.2\\% of adversarial examples have semantic meaning differ from the original sentences.",
      "It shows that our algorithm only needs to change 2 or 3 words on average and can generate entirely different outputs for more than 80\\% of sentences. We have also included some adversarial examples in Table ~. % From these examples, we can only change one word to let output sequence look completely different with the original one and change the sentence's meaning completely.",
      "\\citet{alzantot2018generating proposed a genetic algorithm to attack sentiment analysis. These approaches differ from our method in that they study simple text classification problems while we focus on the more challenging seq2seq model with sequential outputs. Other than attacking text classifiers, \\citet{jia2017adversarial aims to fool reading comprehension systems by adding misleading sentences, which has a different focus than ours."
