      "Consequently, it is assigned the metallic material, which is incorrect. When the material approaches an arbitrarily complex illumination seen in a mirror, no network can capture all 4D variation anymore. This relation is shown in the inset plot (\\refFig{GlossVsError) where the vertical axis denotes error, which is decreasing when specular is decreased as well, along the horizontal axis.",
      "\\refTbl{Main, top part, shows results as mean error across the data set. We see that for all data sets our method is a better representation in terms of having a lower DSSIM error. The difference in error is more pronounced for \\textsc{NovelView than for \\textsc{SameView.",
      "Dark hues are the competitor and light hues ours. Results \\mysubsection{Protocol{Protocol Here we evaluate our deep appearance representation (\\refSec{RepresentationAnalysis), as well as its application to learning-to-learn appearance (\\refSec{LearningToLearnAnalysis) and joint material estimation-and-segmentation (\\refSec{SegmentationAnalysis). Instrumentation for all tasks is performed in a similar fashion using our multi-view, multi-material data set (\\refSec{DataSet).",
      "In each application we also consider one application-specific competitor to solve the task. We use perfect classic reflectance maps for appearance representation , an upper bound with what could be estimated . SGD is the common solution to learn appearance.",
      "For learning-to-learn \\refFig{FailureModes, right, SGD might produce the right network, but the learned network overshoots. Similarly, highlights tend to be more blurry (not shown). For segmentation \\refFig{FailureModes, middle, the rim highlight in the back of the character is purely white and apparently does not look enough like other highlights on blue to be understood.",
      "A detailed plot of error distribution is seen in \\refFig{Plots, left. This is, as classic reflectance map captures appearance for a fixed viewer location, for changing geometry, but does not generalize when the viewer moves. Arguably, classic RMs look qualitatively plausible without a reference, but only have low quantitative similarity (SSIM) in novel views.",
      "We have proposed and explored a novel take on appearance processing that neither works on pixel-level IBR-like representations nor by extracting classic explicit reflectance and illumination parameters. Instead, we work on a deep representation of appearance itself, defined on a generalization of reflectance maps that works in world space where observations cover all directions. We have shown to enables effective reproduction, estimation by learning-to-learn and joint material estimation-and-segmentation.",
      "While being marginally worse, it is two orders of magnitude faster. \\refFig{Plots show the error distribution across the data set. A visual comparison is found in \\refFig{LearningToLearnResults."
