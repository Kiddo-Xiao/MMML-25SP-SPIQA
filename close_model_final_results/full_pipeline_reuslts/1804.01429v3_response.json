      "Introduction Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought significant improvements to many fundamental computer vision tasks, including video action recognition . Current action recognition methods are able to detect, recognize or localize general actions and identify the agents (people, vehicles, etc.) . However, in applications such as surveillance, relevant actions often involve locations and moving directions that relate to to scene layouts --for example, it might be of interest to detect (and issue an alert about) a person walking towards the front door of a house, but not to detect a person walking along the sidewalk.",
      "\\noindent Training and Testing Details. Our action recognition task is formulated as multi-label classification without mutual exclusion. The network is trained using the Adam optimizer with 0.001 initial learning rate.",
      "In contrast to these datasets that were designed to evaluate motion and appearance modeling, or human-object interactions, our Agent-in-Place Action (APA) dataset is the first one that focuses on actions that are defined with respect to scene layouts, including interaction with places and moving directions. Recognizing these actions requires the network to not only detect and recognize agent categories and motion patterns, but also how they interact with the layout of the semantic classes in the scene. With the large variations of scene layouts, it is critical to explicitly model scene layout in the network to improve generalization on unseen scenes.",
      "We observe that: 1) the testing performance gap between observed and unseen scenes is large, which reveals the poor generalization of the baseline models; 2) marginal improvements are obtained by incorporating scene layout information using ConcateMap, which suggests that it is difficulty for the network to learn the human-scene interactions directly from the raw pixels and segmentation maps. In addition, we also train a B/L2 model with 6\\times more filters per layer to evaluate whether model size is the key factor for the performance improvement. The result of this enlarged B/L2 model is shown in column 5 of Table .",
      "For some actions, especially the ones occurring on street and sidewalk, since they are relatively easy to recognize, adding DD or Topo-Agg upon the place-based feature descriptions (PD) does not help much. Overall, LIVR improves the generalization capability of the network, especially for actions that are more challenging, and are associated with moving directions. \\noindentQualitative Results.",
      "Some example actions are visualized using three frames in temporal order and the predicted probabilities of the groundtruth actions using different methods are reported in Fig.. It is observed that for relatively easy actions such as <vehicle, move along, street>, performance is similar across approaches. However, for challenging actions, especially ones requiring modeling moving directions such as <person, move toward (home), walkway>, our method outperforms baselines significantly.",
      "The biggest challenge of agent-in-place action recognition is to generalize a model trained with limited scenes to unseen scenes. Previous work on knowledge transfer for both images and videos has been based on visual similarity, which requires a large amount of training data . For trajectory prediction, Ballan \\etal transferred the priors of statistics from training scenes to new scenes based on scene similarity.",
      "An interesting future directions would be to include integrate the estimation of the semantic maps into the network architecture, which may require collecting more scenes for training. {\\small \\bibliographystyle{ieee \\bibliography{egbib"
