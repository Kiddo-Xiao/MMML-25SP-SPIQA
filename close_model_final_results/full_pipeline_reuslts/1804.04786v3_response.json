Compared with these approaches, the proposed framework incorporates both image and audio in the recurrent unit to achieve temporal dependency in the generated video on both facial and lip movements, such that smooth transition across different video frames can be realized. We also observe that the image and audio features (or hybrid features) learned by minimizing the reconstruction error between the generated and ground truth frames are insufficient to accurately guide lip movement.",
      "The reconstruction error alone is insufficient to accurately guide the lip movement during the training stage because it only calculates the averaged pixel-wise distance, instead of semantically penalizing the inaccurate lip movements. % To solve this problem, we use a lip-reading model as a semantic lip guidance, \\ie, a lip-reading discriminator, to update the generator in an adversarial manner. % The objective function for updating the lip-reading model D_l is shown in Eq.~. where y is the real word label, the output of D_{l is the predicted probability.",
