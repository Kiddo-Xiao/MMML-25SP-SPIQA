    "answer": "In the FAKEDETECTOR framework, the GDU (Gated Diffusive Unit) is used for modeling relationships among news articles, creators, and subjects by accepting multiple inputs and fusing them effectively. The HFLU (Hybrid Feature Learning Unit) is responsible for learning explicit and latent feature representations from the input data.",

      "{\\our deploys a new hybrid feature learning unit (HFLU) for learning the explicit and latent feature representations of news articles, creators and subjects respectively, and introduce a novel deep diffusive network model with the gated diffusive unit for the heterogeneous information fusion within the social networks. The remaining paper is organized as follows. At first, we will introduce several important concepts and formulate the {\\problem problem in Section~. Before introducing the proposed framework, we will provide a detailed analysis about fake news dataset in Section~, which will provide useful signals for the framework building.",
      "Here, let's take news articles as an example. Formally, among all the inputs of the GDU model, \\mb{x_i denotes the extracted feature vector from HFLU for news articles, \\mb{z_i represents the input from other GDUs corresponding to subjects, and \\mb{t_i represents the input from other GDUs about creators. Considering that the GDU for each news article may be connected to multiple GDUs of subjects and creators, the mean(\\cdot) of the outputs from the GDUs corresponding to these subjects and creators will be computed as the inputs \\mb{z_i and \\mb{t_i instead respectively, which is also indicated by the GDU architecture illustrated in Figure~. For the inputs from the subjects, GDU has a gate called the ``forget gate'', which may update some content of \\mb{z_i to forget.",
      "Each news article can belong to multiple subjects, and each subject can also have multiple news articles taking it as the main topics. To model the correlation among news articles, creators and subjects, we will introduce the deep diffusive network model as follow. The overall architecture of {\\our corresponding to the case study shown in Figure~ is provided in Figure~. Besides the HFLU feature learning unit model, {\\our also uses a gated diffusive unit (GDU) model for effective relationship modeling among news articles, creators and subjects, whose structure is illustrated in Figure~. Formally, the GDU model accepts multiple inputs from different sources simultaneously, i.e., \\mb{x_i, \\mb{z_i and \\mb{t_i, and outputs its learned hidden state \\mb{h_i to the output layer and other unit models in the diffusive network architecture.",
      "Formally, we can represent the final output of GDU as where \\mb{g_i = \\sigma ( \\mb{W_g \\left[\\mb{x_i^\\top, \\mb{z_i^\\top, \\mb{t_i^\\top \\right]^\\top ), and \\mb{r_i = \\sigma ( \\mb{W_r \\left[\\mb{x_i^\\top, \\mb{z_i^\\top, \\mb{t_i^\\top \\right]^\\top ), and term \\mb{1 denotes a vector filled with value 1. Operators \\oplus and \\ominus denote the entry-wise addition and minus operation of vectors. Matrices \\mb{W_u, \\mb{W_g, \\mb{W_r represent the variables involved in the components.",
      "Based on these observations, we will build a unified credibility inference model to identify the fake news articles, creators and subjects simultaneously from the network with a deep diffusive network model in the next section. Proposed Methods In this section, we will provide the detailed information about the {\\our framework in this section. Framework {\\our covers two main components: representation feature learning, and credibility label inference, which together will compose the deep diffusive network model {\\our.",
      "Furthermore, based on the connections among news articles, creators and news subjects, a deep diffusive network model has been proposed for incorporate the network structure information into model learning. In this paper, we also introduce a new diffusive unit model, namely GDU. Model GDU accepts multiple inputs from different sources simultaneously, and can effectively fuse these input for output generation with content ``forget'' and ``adjust'' gates.",
      "Vector \\mb{h_i will be the output of the GDU model. The introduced GDU model also works for both the news subjects and creator nodes in the network. When applying the GDU to model the states of the subject/creator nodes with two input only, the remaining input port can be assigned with a default value (usually vector \\mb{0).",
      "Based on the GDU, we can denote the overall architecture of the {\\our as shown in Figure~, where the lines connecting the GDUs denote the data flow among the unit models. In the following section, we will introduce how to learn the parameters involved in the {\\our model for concurrent credibility inference of multiple nodes. Deep Diffusive Network Model Learning"
