For example, if we partitioned the US into 200 clusters where 199 of them were in Alaska and one cluster covered the rest of the country, we would obtain an almost perfect Q-metric as relatively few users would cross between clusters. However, such a clustering would not be useful for our applications.", "We evaluate GeoCUTS on these metrics, showing that it outperforms balanced partitioning baselines, and performs comparably to the state-of-the-art in hand-designed clustering. \\section*{Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank Kay Brodersen and Hal Varian for helpful advice.

We would then face the problem of modeling user response to varying levels of treatment over time. As a user travels from region to region, he or she will be exposed to various values of treatment. For example, assume that a user's response is proportional to their ``treatment dose'', i.e.~the ratio of queries made within treated regions over the total queries made.", "Users can clear their cookies whenever they want, and they frequently use multiple devices and multiple browsers.'' The authors further observe that ``Using a signed-in id may seem to mitigate this issue, but users can have multiple sign-ins and many queries are made while signed-out.'' Thus the effect measured by a cookie experiment is diluted by the fact that a user may be in the treatment group on one device or browser and in the control group in another."], "referred_text_chunks": ["On the other hand, while some highly mobile users may issue fewer queries, they tend to move over a wider range.
