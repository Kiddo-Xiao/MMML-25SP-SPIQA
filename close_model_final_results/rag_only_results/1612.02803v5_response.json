When it is stretched or compressed, there will be a force acting on the object that stretches or compresses it. The force is always pointing toward the equilibrium position.", "If we compress the spring and release it at point x_0, the system will start oscillating, i.e., at time t, the position of the particle is X(t) = x_0\\cos(\\omega t), where \\omega=\\sqrt{\\cK/m is the oscillating frequency.
