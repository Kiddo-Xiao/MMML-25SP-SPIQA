The benefit to this approach is that it can re-use the noisy z^t variables across time steps, rather than re-drawing new noise each time. The problem is that, while each z^t is small in magnitude, there are many of them; for example, the final \\hat{q^T contains T pieces of noise, which add up to a very inaccurate estimate of the true market state.", "Note that r_j < 0, or ``short selling'' security j, is allowed.

The privacy level thus determines how close \\hat{q is to q. The distance from \\nabla C(\\hat{q) to \\nabla C(q) is then controlled by the price sensitivity \\lambda. For a fixed noise and privacy level, a smaller \\lambda leads to small impact of noise on prices, meaning very good accuracy.", "= \\sum_{s\\leq t dq^s.
