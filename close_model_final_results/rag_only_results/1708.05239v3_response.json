In particular, MCMC algorithms have been extensively applied within the field of Bayesian statistics to sample from posterior distributions when the posterior density can only be evaluated up to a constant of proportionality. Under mild conditions, it can be shown that asymptotically, the limiting distribution of the samples generated from the MCMC algorithm will converge to the posterior distribution of interest.", "In Scenario (a), where the modes are well-separated, the HMC sampler is only able to explore the modes locally clustered together, whereas the pseudo-extended HMC sampler is able to explore all of the modes, for the same number of iterations.
