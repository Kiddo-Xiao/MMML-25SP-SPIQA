This means it will not be able to efficiently model dependencies and interactions between words that are a few steps apart. LSTMs are able to tackle this issue by their use of gating mechanisms.", "The first leverages neural networks for sequential modeling of text.

These features serve as input to a bidirectional LSTM model.", "They used distributional semantics to represent article titles, and BiLSTM to model sequential data and its dependencies.
