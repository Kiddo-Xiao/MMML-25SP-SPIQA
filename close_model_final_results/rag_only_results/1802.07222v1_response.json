Thus, even a small network outage can cause the host kernel to ``panic'' and reboot the guest VM. We mentioned that over 70\\% of VM reboots caused by network issues in our datacenters cannot be explained using currently deployed monitoring systems.", "We use BGP in our datacenter and a lossy link may cause one or more BGP sessions to fail, triggering rerouting. Then, the traceroute packets may take a different path than the original connection. However, RTTs in a datacenter are typically less than 1 or 2~ms, so TCP retransmits a dropped packet quickly.", "We repave the cluster by setting all devices to a clean state. We then run \\Sys without injecting any failures.

Spurious retransmissions triggered by timeouts may also occur if there is sudden increased delay on forward or reverse paths. This can happen due to rerouting, or large queue buildups.", "It is possible that packet loss on the reverse path is so severe that loss of ACK packets triggers timeout at the sender. If this happens, the traceroute would not be going over any link that triggered the packet drop. Since TCP ACKs are cumulative, this is typically not a problem and \\Sys assumes retransmissions in such cases are unlikely."], "referred_text_chunks": ["To further illustrate how important this issue can be, Figure~ shows the number of unexplained VM reboots due to network problems in one day of operations: there were on average~10 VM reboots per hour due to unexplained network problems.
