For the inputs from the subjects, GDU has a gate called the ``forget gate'', which may update some content of \\mb{z_i to forget.", "Each news article can belong to multiple subjects, and each subject can also have multiple news articles taking it as the main topics.

Besides the HFLU feature learning unit model, {\\our also uses a gated diffusive unit (GDU) model for effective relationship modeling among news articles, creators and subjects, whose structure is illustrated in Figure~. Formally, the GDU model accepts multiple inputs from different sources simultaneously, i.e., \\mb{x_i, \\mb{z_i and \\mb{t_i, and outputs its learned hidden state \\mb{h_i to the output layer and other unit models in the diffusive network architecture.", "Formally, we can represent the final output of GDU as where \\mb{g_i = \\sigma ( \\mb{W_g \\left[\\mb{x_i^\\top, \\mb{z_i^\\top, \\mb{t_i^\\top \\right]^\\top ), and \\mb{r_i = \\sigma ( \\mb{W_r \\left[\\mb{x_i^\\top, \\mb{z_i^\\top, \\mb{t_i^\\top \\right]^\\top ), and term \\mb{1 denotes a vector filled with value 1.
