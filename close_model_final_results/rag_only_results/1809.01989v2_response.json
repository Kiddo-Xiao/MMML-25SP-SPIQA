Baseline, Ridge, and Cluster have similar accuracy, while Sector is slightly worse. Second is the sign of the error: trackers aim to match or exceed the index, and avoid underperforming it.", "It is the most intuitive index tracking approach and provides perfect tracking performance in a frictionless market. However, in practice, it leads to high transaction cost due to large numbers of index constituents, frequently rebalancing, churn in index members, and illiquid assets . In contrast, partial replication selects a small subset of assets from the index and rebalances at lower frequency (full replication usually require daily rebalancing).", "Introduction The purpose of index tracking is to create an investment portfolio to replicate the performance of a certain market index, e.g., S\\&P500. In general, there are two ways to build such a tracking portfolio: full replication and partial replication. Full replication is simply to hold all the assets in the same proportions as the market index.", "Most interestingly, we show that the way we introduce diversity uniquely entails an easy way to achieve sparsity through a reweighed \\ell_1 norm. Methodology Practical partial index tracking has three key requirements: (i) The selected portfolio should have minimum error with respect to the true index.", "This significantly reduces transaction cost, but affects index tracking accuracy. Thus the optimisation problem of partial replication is to compose a small portfolio of assets with minimum index tracking error. This can be seen as involving two sub-problems: asset selection, selecting which subset of assets to hold; and asset allocation, distributing capital among the selected assets.", "Here we choose to use Spearman's \\rho .
