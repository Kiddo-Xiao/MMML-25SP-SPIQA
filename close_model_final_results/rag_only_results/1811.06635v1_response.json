In particular, if the design matrix \\bX satisfies the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) then algorithms such as CoSamp~, Subspace Pursuit (SP)~ and Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) can recover \\bbeta^* quite efficiently and in a stable way with a sample complexity of O(s \\log\\frac{d{s). Many algorithms use random matrices such as Gaussian (or sub-Gaussian in general) and Bernoulli random matrices because it is known that these matrices satisfy RIP with high probability~.", "Main results In this section, we state our results for the standard compressed sensing and one-bit compressed sensing.
