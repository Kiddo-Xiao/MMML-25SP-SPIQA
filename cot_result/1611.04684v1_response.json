    "question": "What are the main differences between the educational philosophies of the Bonaparte and Voltaire schools?",
    "ground_truth": "The Bonaparte school focuses on outdoor physical activities, maneuvers, and strategies, with a specialization in horse riding, lances, and swords. They aim to develop students into good leaders. The Voltaire school, on the other hand, encourages independent thinking and focuses on indoor activities. They aim to instill good moral values and develop students into philosophical thinkers.",
