    "question": "How does the discrimination in the prediction of the two-phase framework (MSG) compare to that of DI, both with and without classifier tweaking, when the sample size is 2000?",
    "ground_truth": "When the sample size is 2000, the two-phase framework (MSG) achieves lower discrimination in prediction compared to DI, both with and without classifier tweaking.\n\nWith classifier tweaking: MSG achieves a discrimination level of 0.016 \u00b1 5.3E-4, while DI shows a significantly higher level of 0.095 \u00b1 1.6E-3.\nWithout classifier tweaking: MSG still demonstrates lower discrimination with 0.067 \u00b1 4.3E-3 compared to DI's 0.095 \u00b1 1.6E-3.\n\nThis indicates that the two-phase framework is more effective in removing discrimination from predictions than DI, regardless of whether classifier tweaking is applied.",
