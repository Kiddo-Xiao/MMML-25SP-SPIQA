    "question": "What is the relationship between the number of Monte Carlo samples (N) and the translation performance of the BR-CSGAN model? Why is there a trade-off when choosing the value of N?",
    "ground_truth": "The table and passage show that the translation performance of the BR-CSGAN model generally improves as the number of Monte Carlo samples (N) increases. However, this improvement plateaus after N reaches a certain point (around 20 in this case).\n\nThere is a trade-off when choosing the value of N because increasing N also increases the computational complexity and training time. While a higher N leads to more accurate reward estimations and better performance, it also requires more computational resources and longer training times. Therefore, choosing the optimal N involves balancing the desired performance with the available computational resources and time constraints.",

This trade-off arises because increasing the number of Monte Carlo samples (N) can improve the translation performance of the model, but it also increases the computational cost of training the model.\n\nIn the case of the BR-CSGAN model, the number of Monte Carlo samples ("

    "ground_truth": "BR-CSGAN consistently outperforms MRT on both Chinese-English and English-German translation tasks, achieving higher BLEU scores.\n\nWhile both methods optimize similar objectives, BR-CSGAN uses a reinforcement learning procedure with a dynamic discriminator to maximize rewards for the generator. This dynamic feedback seems to be more effective than the static objective and random sampling approach used by MRT, leading to better translation performance.",
