    "ground_truth": "According to Table 2, Moses achieves the highest BLEU scores among the listed translation systems (Moses, Nematus) across all language pairs. However, its performance still falls behind Google Translate (GT) in every case.\n\nThe comparison with GT might not be entirely fair because, as GT has the advantage of being trained on a significantly larger dataset. This suggests that GT's performance advantage might be partially due to its training data rather than solely its inherent capabilities.",
