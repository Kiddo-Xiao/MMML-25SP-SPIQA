    "question": "How does the alpha parameter affect recommendation accuracy for different sample sizes on the CLASS dataset?",
    "ground_truth": "The alpha parameter generally increases recommendation accuracy as the sample size increases. However, the effect of alpha varies depending on the loss function used. For cross-entropy loss, alpha has a relatively small effect on accuracy. For TOP1-max loss, alpha has a larger effect on accuracy, especially for smaller sample sizes. For BPR-max loss, alpha has a very large effect on accuracy, with higher values of alpha leading to much higher accuracy.",
