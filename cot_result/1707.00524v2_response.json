    "ground_truth": "The predicted frame is generated by the prediction model, while the reconstructed frame is generated by the autoencoder. The predicted frame is typically more accurate than the reconstructed frame, as the prediction model is trained to predict the future state of the environment, while the autoencoder is only trained to reconstruct the input image.",

The encoder network is responsible for compressing the information from the current state and the action into a lower-dimensional representation, while the decoder network is responsible for expanding this lower-dimensional representation back into a higher-dimensional representation of the next state. <s>"
