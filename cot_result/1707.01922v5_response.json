In testing sensor fusion, the source and target CNNs are trained on the same domain, and the joint classifier is used to predict the class of the target data using both the source and target data.",

    "answer": "Testing domain adaptation refers to the process of adapting a model trained on one domain to perform well on a different domain, where the distribution of the data in the target domain may be significantly different from that of the source domain. In contrast, sensor fusion refers to the process of combining data from multiple sensors, such as cameras and depth sensors, to create a more comprehensive representation of the scene. <s>"
