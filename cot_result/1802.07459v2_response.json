Sim & Siam: It employs both term-based similarity encoder (\"Sim\") and Siamese encoder (\"Siam\") for generating matching vectors on vertices.\n3. GCN: It performs convolution on local matching vectors through GCN layers.\n4. Sim$^{g}$: It incorporates additional global features based on the five term-based similarity metrics.",
