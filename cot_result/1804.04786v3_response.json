    "question": "What is the difference between the sequential and recurrent generation schemes?",
    "ground_truth": "The sequential generation scheme generates each frame of the video independently, while the recurrent generation scheme uses the previous frame to generate the next frame. This can be seen in the optical flow images, which show the motion of pixels between frames. The recurrent scheme has a smoother flow of motion, while the sequential scheme has more abrupt changes.",

    "answer": "The main difference between the sequential and recurrent generation schemes is the level of correlation they consider across different frames. The sequential frame generation scheme only considers short-term frame correlation, while the recurrent frame generation scheme preserves long-term dependency by feeding the identity image into all future frame generation. <s>"
