    "answer": "The Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as language modeling, sentiment analysis, and speech recognition. The BiLSTM architecture is designed to capture both left-to-right and right-to-left contextual information in the input sequence, which makes it particularly useful for processing sequential data such as text. <s>"
