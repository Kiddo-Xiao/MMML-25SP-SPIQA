    "answer": "The optimal threshold is chosen to be at the right margin of the region around the mode of the histogram in order to minimize the number of false alarms and maximize the number of correct detections. \n\nThis is because the mode of the histogram represents the most common value in the distribution of the residuals, which are the differences between the ground truth and the estimated background. By choosing the threshold to be at the right margin of the region around the mode, the algorithm is able to capture the majority of the true changes while minimizing the number of false detections. <s>"
