    "question": "How does the performance of the model change as the number of views increases?",
    "ground_truth": "The performance of the model generally improves as the number of views increases. For example, when the model is trained and tested on two-view data, the F1-score is 29.67. However, when the model is trained and tested on three-view data, the F1-score increases to 30.2. This suggests that the model is able to learn more effectively from data with more views.",
