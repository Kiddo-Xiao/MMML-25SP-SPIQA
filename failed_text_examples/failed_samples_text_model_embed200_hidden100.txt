Question: Explain the difference between the features "TF-IDF" and "BM25".
True Answer: Both TF-IDF and BM25 are features used to estimate the relevance of a document to a query. However, they differ in their underlying calculations.

TF-IDF: This feature represents the average product of term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF) for each query term within different document sections (URL, title, content, and whole document). TF measures how often a term appears in a specific document section, while IDF measures how important that term is across the entire document collection.

BM25: This feature utilizes the BM25 ranking function, which is a probabilistic model that considers term frequency, document length, and average document length to estimate relevance. While it also considers term frequency like TF-IDF, it incorporates additional factors to improve the weighting scheme.
Predicted Answer: 5 hops

Question: On the VQAv2-2017 validation set, which model performs best when considering all three sources of information (images, questions, and answers) and how does its performance compare to the model that only uses answers?
True Answer: The model that performs best on VQAv2-2017 val when considering all three sources of information is MLP-IQA. It achieves an accuracy of 61.1% on the \IU+\QU -decoys metric, significantly outperforming the model that only uses answers (MLP-A) which achieves only 27.7% on the same metric. This demonstrates the importance of incorporating all available information for accurate prediction.
Predicted Answer: PWC-Net (ft) achieved the best performance on the KITTI 2015 test set with an F1-all score of 9.16%. This is significantly better than Devon (ft), which achieved an F1-all score of 14.31% on the same dataset.

Question: Why is the optimal threshold chosen to be at the right margin of the region around the mode of the histogram?
True Answer: The region around the mode of the histogram mostly contains noise. Therefore, the optimal threshold is chosen to be at the right margin of this region to avoid including too much noise in the thresholded image.
Predicted Answer:  

Increasing the value of β2 decreases the precision and increases the recall of the model.

Question: Which step in the methodology resulted in the largest decrease in the size of the dataset?
True Answer: Step 4, Reason disambiguation.
Predicted Answer: The passage mentions that additional trajectories were generated for the "Pick and Place" task by reducing the frequency of the recorded demonstrations. This process was not applied to the "Push to Pose" task, therefore no "Demonstrations after shift" are listed for it.

Question: How does the accuracy of the model change as the value of c increases?
True Answer: The accuracy of the model decreases as the value of c increases.
Predicted Answer: The performance of the model generally improves as the number of views increases. For example, when the model is trained and tested on two-view data, the F1-score is 29.67. However, when the model is trained and tested on three-view data, the F1-score increases to 30.2. This suggests that the model is able to learn more effectively from data with more views.
