    "answer": "Conventional distant supervision is problematic because it relies solely on co-occurrence statistics, which may not be sufficient to capture the complex relationships between entities in a knowledge base. \n\nIn summary, conventional distant supervision is limited in its ability to capture the nuances and subtleties of the relationships between entities in a knowledge base, as it relies solely on co-occurrence statistics. To address this limitation, researchers have developed more sophisticated models, such as GloRE and LoRE, which incorporate adversarial training and other techniques to better capture the complementary information"
