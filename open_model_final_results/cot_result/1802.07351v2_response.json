    "answer": "Deformable cost volumes are a more advanced version of standard cost volumes, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks such as image segmentation, object detection, and optical flow estimation. Deformable cost volumes are an extension of standard cost volumes that allow for more flexibility in the shape and size of the cost volumes, making them better suited for tasks such as 3D object recognition and pose estimation. This is achieved through the use of deformable convolutions, which are a type of convolutional layer that allows the network to adjust the size and shape of the receptive field based on the input data"
