    "question": "What are the key differences between Seq2Sick and existing attack methods on RNN-based models?",
    "ground_truth": "Seq2Sick differs from existing attack methods in two key aspects:\n\n1. Search Strategy: While previous methods primarily rely on greedy search, which becomes increasingly inefficient for longer sequences, Seq2Sick employs group lasso regularization and projected gradient descent with gradient regularization. This allows for simultaneous searching of all replacement positions, leading to improved efficiency.\n\n2. Targeted Attack Type: Existing methods focus on targeting specific classes or binary classifications, while Seq2Sick introduces a novel \"keyword\" target type, allowing attacks to be directed towards specific keywords within the generated sequence.",

    "answer": "The key difference between Seq2Sick and existing attack methods on RNN-based models is that Seq2Sick is specifically designed to attack recurrent neural network (RNN) models, while existing attack methods are more general and can be applied to a variety of machine learning models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as well as RNNs. <s>"
