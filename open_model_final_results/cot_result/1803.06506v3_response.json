    "question": "Why does the Semantic self-supervision model perform better on ReferIt (mask) compared to ReferIt (bbox), and how does this relate to the difference in performance between Visual Genome and Flickr30k datasets? ",
    "ground_truth": "The Semantic self-supervision model performs better on ReferIt (mask) compared to ReferIt (bbox) because mask-based annotations are considered more precise and accurate for measuring localization performance than bounding boxes. Masks tightly encompass the specific region referred to by the phrase, whereas bounding boxes can include extraneous areas. \n\nThis relates to the difference in performance between Visual Genome and Flickr30k because both Visual Genome and ReferIt (mask) contain phrases that refer to very specific regions or non-salient objects. Precise localization is crucial for achieving high accuracy on these datasets. Flickr30k, on the other hand, annotates all bounding boxes referring to a phrase, leading to potentially less precise localization requirements and generally higher performance across methods. ",
