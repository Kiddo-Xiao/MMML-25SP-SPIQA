    "ground_truth": "Both TF-IDF and BM25 are features used to estimate the relevance of a document to a query. However, they differ in their underlying calculations.\n\nTF-IDF: This feature represents the average product of term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF) for each query term within different document sections (URL, title, content, and whole document). TF measures how often a term appears in a specific document section, while IDF measures how important that term is across the entire document collection.\n\nBM25: This feature utilizes the BM25 ranking function, which is a probabilistic model that considers term frequency, document length, and average document length to estimate relevance. While it also considers term frequency like TF-IDF, it incorporates additional factors to improve the weighting scheme.",

    "answer": "TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and BM25 (Bayesian Information Retrieval Using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) are both measures used to evaluate the relevance of a document to a given query. The main difference between the two is that TF-IDF only considers the frequency of a term within a document, while BM25 also takes into account the frequency of a term within all documents in the collection. In other words, TF-IDF is a local measure, while BM25 is a global measure"
