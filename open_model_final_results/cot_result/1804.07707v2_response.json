    "ground_truth": "When trained on the LDC2017T10 dataset, the proposed model achieves the highest BLEU scores on both Dev and Test sets compared to other models listed in the table. This suggests that incorporating syntax into the model significantly improves its performance in generating text from AMR representations.",
