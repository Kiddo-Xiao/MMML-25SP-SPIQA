Why is there a trade-off when choosing the value of N?", "response": {"1703.04887v4-Table3-1.png": ["<s>", "<s>"]}, "referred_figures_names": ["1703.04887v4-Table3-1.png"], "answer": "The table and passage show that the translation performance of the BR-CSGAN model generally improves as the number of Monte Carlo samples (N) increases. However, this improvement plateaus after N reaches a certain point (around 20 in this case).\n\nThere is a trade-off when choosing the value of N because increasing N also increases the computational complexity and training time. While a higher N leads to more accurate reward estimations and better performance, it also requires more computational resources and longer training times. Therefore, choosing the optimal N involves balancing the desired performance with the available computational resources and time constraints."}, "1": {"question": "How does the initial accuracy of the discriminator affect the BLEU score?", "response": {"1703.04887v4-Figure2-1.png": ["Yes <s>", "The initial accuracy of the discriminator affects the BLEU score. <s>"]}, "referred_figures_names": ["1703.04887v4-Figure2-1.png"], "answer": "The BLEU score decreases as the initial accuracy of the discriminator increases."}, "2": {"question": "How does BR-CSGAN compare to MRT in terms of translation performance and what is the likely reason for this difference?", "response": {"1703.04887v4-Table2-1.png": ["1 <s>", "BR-CSGAN outperforms MRT in terms of BLEU score on Chinese-English and English-German translation tasks <s>"]}, "referred_figures_names": ["1703.04887v4-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "BR-CSGAN consistently outperforms MRT on both Chinese-English and English-German translation tasks, achieving higher BLEU scores.\n\nWhile both methods optimize similar objectives, BR-CSGAN uses a reinforcement learning procedure with a dynamic discriminator to maximize rewards for the generator.
