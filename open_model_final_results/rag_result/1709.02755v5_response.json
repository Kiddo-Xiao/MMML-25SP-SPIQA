These include:\n\n1. **Token-based batching:** Instead of grouping sentences of similar lengths together, the training process batches together a fixed number of tokens (5120 tokens per batch). This approach ensures that the model sees a consistent amount of vocabulary regardless of sentence length variation.\n2. **Shared embedding:** This technique maps both source and target words to the same embedding space, effectively reducing the memory footprint needed to store word representations. \n3. **Positional encoding:** This method injects information about the position of words in a sentence into the model, helping it better understand long-range dependencies within the text.
