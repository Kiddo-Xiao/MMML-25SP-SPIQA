Search Strategy: While previous methods primarily rely on greedy search, which becomes increasingly inefficient for longer sequences, Seq2Sick employs group lasso regularization and projected gradient descent with gradient regularization. This allows for simultaneous searching of all replacement positions, leading to improved efficiency.\n\n2. Targeted Attack Type: Existing methods focus on targeting specific classes or binary classifications, while Seq2Sick introduces a novel \"keyword\" target type, allowing attacks to be directed towards specific keywords within the generated sequence."}, "1": {"question": "What is the relationship between the success rate of the non-overlapping attack and the number of words changed in the input sentence?", "response": {"1803.01128v3-Table3-1.png": ["10 <s>", "High BLEU scores and low average number of changed words indicate that the crafted adversarial inputs are very similar to their originals, and we achieve high success rates to generate a summarization that differs with the original at every position for all three datasets. <s>"]}, "referred_figures_names": ["1803.01128v3-Table3-1.png"], "answer": "There is a negative correlation between the success rate of the non-overlapping attack and the number of words changed in the input sentence.
