However, they differ in their underlying calculations.\n\nTF-IDF: This feature represents the average product of term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF) for each query term within different document sections (URL, title, content, and whole document). TF measures how often a term appears in a specific document section, while IDF measures how important that term is across the entire document collection.\n\nBM25: This feature utilizes the BM25 ranking function, which is a probabilistic model that considers term frequency, document length, and average document length to estimate relevance. While it also considers term frequency like TF-IDF, it incorporates additional factors to improve the weighting scheme."}}
