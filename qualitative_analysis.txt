Paper ID: 1811.02721v3
Question: How does the reliability of CoAP compare to TCPlp and what potential factors contribute to this difference?
Image: 1811.02721v3-Table7-1.png
True Answer: Table 1 shows that CoAP has slightly higher reliability (99.5%) compared to TCPlp (99.3%). While both protocols perform well, this difference could be attributed to several factors, including:

Retransmission mechanisms: CoAP employs a built-in retransmission mechanism for lost packets, while TCPlp relies on the underlying network layer for retransmissions. This could give CoAP an edge in recovering lost packets and achieving higher reliability.
Congestion control: CoAP includes mechanisms to adapt to network congestion, potentially reducing packet loss and improving reliability.
Packet size: CoAP typically uses smaller packets compared to TCPlp. Smaller packets are less prone to loss in wireless networks, potentially contributing to CoAP's slightly higher reliability.
