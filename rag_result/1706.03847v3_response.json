However, the effect of alpha varies depending on the loss function used. For cross-entropy loss, alpha has a relatively small effect on accuracy. For TOP1-max loss, alpha has a larger effect on accuracy, especially for smaller sample sizes. For BPR-max loss, alpha has a very large effect on accuracy, with higher values of alpha leading to much higher accuracy."}, "1": {"question": "Which combination of method and dataset achieved the highest Recall@20 score, and how much higher was it compared to the original GRU4Rec model?", "response": {"1706.03847v3-Table2-1.png": ["10.5% <s>", "Recall@20 <s>"]}, "referred_figures_names": ["1706.03847v3-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "The highest Recall@20 score was achieved by the GRU4Rec with additional samples and BPR-max loss function on the RSC15 dataset.
