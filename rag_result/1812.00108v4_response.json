For example, when the model is trained and tested on two-view data, the F1-score is 29.67. However, when the model is trained and tested on three-view data, the F1-score increases to 30.2. This suggests that the model is able to learn more effectively from data with more views."}, "2": {"question": "Which method achieved the highest F1 score on the Lobby dataset?", "response": {"1812.00108v4-Table2-1.png": ["1 <s>", "Fixed-cameras multi-view f1-scores <s>"]}, "referred_figures_names": ["1812.00108v4-Table2-1.png"], "answer": "Ours-supervised achieved the highest F1 score on the Lobby dataset with a score of 93.4."}}
